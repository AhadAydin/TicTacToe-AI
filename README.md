# TicTacToe AI
Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that you can play against the computer. The game is implemented using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization. The computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves.

# Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, such as Tic-Tac-Toe. It evaluates the possible outcomes of each move and chooses the best move for the computer player, assuming that the human player also plays optimally. The algorithm recursively explores the game tree, considering all possible moves and their resulting game states.

In this implementation, the Minimax algorithm is used to determine the computer's moves. The algorithm assigns scores to each possible move and selects the move with the highest score, assuming the human player will also play optimally. This allows the computer to make intelligent decisions and play a strong game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
